**DSA (Most Critical):**
- One medium problem daily, but give yourself 45 minutes instead of 30
- If you can't solve it completely, spend 15 minutes understanding the solution
- Keep a simple log of patterns you struggle with (dynamic programming, trees, etc.)

**Communication Practice (Embedded):**
- While solving DSA: explain your approach out loud as if talking to an interviewer
- Record yourself solving one problem weekly - you'll notice where you're unclear
- This kills two birds with one stone.
- Have a backup plan: if you miss your main session, do one easy DSA problem to keep the streak
